# Restoration Plan

We are working with the Sandhills Prescribed Burn Association, the North Carolina Natural Resources Commission, and other groups to achieve our restoration goals.

Goals:

* Implement a prescribed fire regime
* Phase out Loblolly pine and replace with Shortleaf
* Preserve and improve streamside buffers and deciduous woodlands
* Remove invasive species (Ligsturgium, Ailanthus, Microstegium)
* Add and expand habitat types: edge, meadow, etc.

Timeline:

* 1-5 years: introduce prescribed fire, first commercial thinning, replant harvested areas with Shortleaf pine
* 5-7 years: more fire
* 7-10 years: harvest more Loblolly
* Ongoing: more fire
